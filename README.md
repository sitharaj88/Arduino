## Blinking LED

**Filename:** `BlinkingLED/BlinkingLED.ino`

This program demonstrates how to blink an LED connected to pin 13 of the Arduino board.

## Temperature Sensor LM35

**Filename:** `TemperatureSensorLM35/TemperatureSensorLM35.ino`

This program reads temperature data from an LM35 sensor and prints it to the serial monitor.

## Servo Control

**Filename:** `ServoControl/ServoControl.ino`

This program controls a servo motor connected to pin 9, moving it to 0, 90, and 180 degrees.

## Button Control LED

**Filename:** `ButtonControlLED/ButtonControlLED.ino`

This program uses a button to control an LED connected to pin 13.

## Analog Input Read

**Filename:** `AnalogInputRead/AnalogInputRead.ino`

This program reads an analog input value from pin A0 and prints it to the serial monitor.

## LCD Display

**Filename:** `LCDDisplay/LCDDisplay.ino`

This program demonstrates how to use a 16x2 LCD display to show a static message on the first row and the number of seconds since the Arduino was reset on the second row.

## Keypad and LCD

**Filename:** `KeypadLCD/KeypadLCD.ino`

This program demonstrates how to use a 4x4 keypad to input data and display it on a 16x2 LCD. The keypad is used to input characters, which are then displayed on the LCD.
